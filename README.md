# timedquiz

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

todo

* message appear when click wrong answer
* message appear when click right answer
* message appear when click no answer
* find a way you cant change answers 
* fix editing 
* scores page
